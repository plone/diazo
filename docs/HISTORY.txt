0.3rc1 - 2010-05-23
-------------------

  [elro]

* XInclude processing is now enabled by default
  [elro]

* XSL directives inlined in the rules file are now supported (e.g.
  <xsl:strip-space elements="*" />). With the inline XSL support, there should
  now be no need for extra.xsl.
  [elro]

* libxml2 quotes CR characters on output, causing Firefox to insert extra
  blank lines in ``<pre>`` blocks. As HTTP specified CRLF line endings for
  form this was a problem for us. This is now caught by the compiled XSL.
  [elro]

* Support for including complete fragment documents with SSI/ESI.
  [elro]

* A bug on namespace upgrade is fixed, but you should update your namespace to
  http://namespaces.plone.org/xdv anyway.
  [elro]
