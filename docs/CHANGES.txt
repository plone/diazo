1.0.6 (2014-09-11)
------------------

* Use formencode's xml_compare method to compare test results. This solves test
  failures on several systems.
  [timo]

* Also evaluate if-not-content. However, we are at risk of replicating
  apply-conditions.xsl in it's entirety. this needs refactoring.
  [lentinj]

* Remove any xml:lang attribute from content to prevent multiple
  xml:lang attributes when the html tag's attributes are copied.
  [danjacka]

------------------

  defined as ``request.host``.
  [davidjb]

1.0.3 (2012-11-11)
------------------

* Support selectors matching multiple elements for merge attributes, e.g.
  ``<merge attributes="class" css:theme="body" css:content="#one, #two"/>``
  [elro]

* Also evaluate merged-condition. This means a rule tag will turn red
  when a condition on an outer rules tag doesn't match.
  [lentinj]

* use boolean(), not count() for if-content. Otherwise we
  generate expressions like "count(nodeset and other_nodeset)",
  which aren't valid.
  [lentinj]

* Output contents of error log as part of debugging output
  [lentinj]

* Debugging output.
  [lentinj]

  [djay]

1.0.2 (2012-08-30)
------------------

* Handle error when serializing empty responses by returning an unthemed
  response. Previously, empty text/html responses resulted in an raised
  exception, resulting in a 500 response and no output.
  [davidjb]

* Allow attributes (i.e. xml:id) to pass through on drop @attribute nodes
  [lentinj]

1.0.1 (2012-05-09)

1.0rc3 - 2011-07-04
-------------------

* Support for ``filter_xpath`` requests for ESI/SSI includes.

1.0b1 - 2011-04-22
------------------

* Updated css namespace url to http://namespaces.plone.org/diazo/css

* Added <replace content="...">...</replace> directive.

* Added the ``wsgi`` module, which contains a WSGI middleware filter for
  applying a Diazo themes, as well as a lower level one for applying an
  XSLT transformation to HTML output.

* Moved documentation from the README to the diazo.org website. See
  http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.org/diazo-docs/trunk.

* Added ``<merge />`` directive

* Added ``<notheme />`` directive

* Added ``<strip />`` directive

* Revised rule set to be based on ``theme-children`` and ``content-children``
  and an explicit ``attributes`` parameter. ``<copy />`` is now only used for
  copying of attributes. ``<prepend />`` and ``<append />`` are deprecated
  in favour of ``<before />`` and ``<after />`` using ``theme-children``.

* Use experimental.cssselect to better work with location paths.

* Renamed XDV to Diazo.

0.4b3 - 2010-09-09
------------------

* Path conditions with @if-path.

* Fix for themes in nested rules tags.

0.4b2 - 2010-08-16
------------------

* When no conditional themes match, pass the document through without theming.

* Fix loading of compiler stylesheets so as not to be affected by resolvers.

0.4b1 - 2010-08-06
------------------

* Multistage compiler breaks down work into smaller, more easily debugged
  chunks. (In the spirit of the original DVNG prototype.)

* Refactoring of generated XSLT to perform its work in a single pass, bringing
  a 30-50% speedup.

* Multiple theme support using the new <theme> directive.

* Nested <rules> and condition merging allows for condition grouping.

* Allow comments to be selected in the theme.

* Tweaked ``ssi`` includemode for Apache compatibility. The previous
  ``wait="yes"`` behaviour no longer seems necessary with current versions of
  Nginx, but is available using the ``ssiwait`` includemode.

* CSS expressions are now converted to relative rather than absolute xpaths.
  While this makes no difference to their use in diazo directives (which are
  executed in the context of the root node), more flexibility is available
  when used with inline XSL.
