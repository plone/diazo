Changelog
=========

0.4b2 - unreleased
------------------

* When no conditional themes match, pass the document through without theming.

* Fix loading of compiler stylesheets so as not to be affected by resolvers.

0.4b1 - 2010-08-06
------------------

* Multistage compiler breaks down work into smaller, more easily debugged
  chunks. (In the spirit of the original DVNG prototype.)

* Refactoring of generated XSLT to perform its work in a single pass, bringing
  a 30-50% speedup.

* Multiple theme support using the new <theme> directive.

* Nested <rules> and condition merging allows for condition grouping.

* Allow comments to be selected in the theme.

* Tweaked ``ssi`` includemode for Apache compatibility. The previous
  ``wait="yes"`` behaviour no longer seems necessary with current versions of
  Nginx, but is available using the ``ssiwait`` includemode.

* CSS expressions are now converted to relative rather than absolute xpaths.
  While this makes no difference to their use in xdv directives (which are
  executed in the context of the root node), more flexibility is available
  when used with inline XSL.
